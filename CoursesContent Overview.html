    <h1> Memory</h1>
    <img src="ram5.png" width="450" height="400">
    <P>Random access memory (RAM) is the hardware in a computing device that provides temporary storage for the operating system (OS), 
        software programs and any other data in current use so they're quickly available to the device's processor.
        <br>
        andom access memory is considered part of a computer's primary memory. It is much faster to read from and write to than secondary storage, such as hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs) or optical drives. However, RAM is volatile; it retains data only as long as the computer is on. If power is lost, so is the data. When the computer is rebooted,
        the OS and other files must be reloaded into RAM, usually from an HDD or SSD.

    <fieldset><h1>  Power Supply</h1>
    <img src="p.png" width="450" height="400" >
    <p> A power supply unit (PSU) converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a desktop computer.
        Modern personal computers universally use switched-mode power supplies, Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting input voltage,
        while others automatically adapt to the main voltage
        <br>
        Power Supply Units (PSU) do not supply systems with power - instead they convert it. Specifically, a power supply converts the alternating high voltage current (AC) into direct current (DC), 
        and they also regulate the DC output voltage to the fine tolerances required for modern computing component
